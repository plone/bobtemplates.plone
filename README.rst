Installation
============

Use in a buildout
-----------------

::

    [buildout]
    parts += mrbob

    [mrbob]
    recipe = zc.recipe.egg
    eggs =
        mr.bob
        bobtemplates.plone

    [sources]
    # if you want to make local changes on the templates
    bobtemplates.plone = git https://github.com/collective/bobtemplates.plone.git pushurl=git@github.com:collective/bobtemplates.plone.git


This creates a mrbob-executeable in your bin-directory.
Call it from the ``src``-directory of your Plone project like this.::

    $ ../bin/mrbob -O collective.foo bobtemplates:plone_addon


Installation in a virtualenv
----------------------------

You can also install ``bobtemplates.plone`` in a virtualenv.::

    $ pip install mr.bob

    $ pip install bobtemplates.plone

Now you can use it like this::

    $ mrbob -O collective.foo bobtemplates:plone_addon
