1.0.2 (2016-04-13)
------------------

- Create uninstall profile also for Plone 4.3.x, since it already depends on ``Products.CMFQuickInstallerTool >= 3.0.9``.

- Update Plone versions to 4.3.9 and 5.0.4.
  [thet]

  [thet]

  higher.  This is included by default in Plone 4.3.8 and 5.0.3 but
  should be fine to use on older Plone versions.  [maurits]

- Removed ``.*`` from the ``.gitignore`` file.  This would ignore the
  ``.gitkeep`` files, which would mean some directories are not added
  when you do ``git add`` after generating a new project.  [maurits]

  [thet]

- Remove the ``xmlns:five`` namespace, as it is not used at all.

- Declare the xml encoding for all GenericSetup profile files.
  Otherwise the parser has to autodetect it.
  Also add an xml version and encoding declaration to ``theme.xml``.

- Add "(uninstall)" to the uninstall profile title.
  Otherwise it cannot be distinguished from the install profile in portal_setup.
  [thet]

- Simplify concatenation of ``.rst`` files for ``setup.py``.
  [thet]

- Update ``.gitignores`` in repository to exclude ``lib64``, ``pip-selfcheck.json`` and all ``.*`` except necessary.
  Update ``.gitignore.bob`` in templates with these changes too.
  Add ``.gitattributes`` in repository for union-merge CHANGES.rst files.
  [thet]

- Update docs and README
